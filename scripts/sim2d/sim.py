    Parameters
    ----------
    fitness_mode : "v1" | "v2" | "v3" | "v4"
        v1: distance + lap bonus - CTE + speed (original)
        v2: lap-time based — completing laps fast is king
        v3: track-keeping first — nonlinear CTE⁴ penalty, reward progress,
            speed only matters through completing laps
        v4: boundary-aware — terminate if outside track, penalize near boundary
